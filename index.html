    <h2>Croissant</h2>

    <h4>Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
    Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed
    in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made
    them into a fast food that can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
    Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in
    French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.</h4>
